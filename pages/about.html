		<p> Polyglot is a social networking service for people who are having a hard time dealing with language barriers. It provides the translating system for users to understand other user's statements. The main approach of Polyglot is to give the opportunity to connect with people despite the language they speak. Being able to communicate with other people with distinct language would be of great help.</p>
